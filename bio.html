          <p><span class="name">Ian Avi Arnold</span> is a Brooklyn-based musician, composer, producer, and educator.</p>
          <p>Originally hailing from just outside Washington, D.C., his love for music became apparent at age four, when he first started banging on the upright piano his parents were babysitting for a friend.</p>
          <p>After eight years of classical training, he switched to jazz piano, a style he felt at home with due to its focus on creative improvisation. After that point, he began composing, recording, and producing his own work using music software. Excelling at both guitar and piano, he has performed in jazz ensembles, rock, folk, and funk bands, to name a few.</p>
          <p>Ian is a graduate of New York University's Gallatin School of Individualized Study, where he studied music technology, composition, and consciousness in an interdisciplinary program. A tutor for many years, Ian discovered how much he enjoys working with kids by tutoring elementary through high school students in math, reading, and writing.</p>
          <p>Since then, he has taught piano, guitar, songwriting, and music production to students of all ages. Ian has also worked at recording studios, scored multiple short films and a full-length play, and composed and produced two EPs of electronic, sample-based music. He is currently at work on his first full-length album release.</p>
